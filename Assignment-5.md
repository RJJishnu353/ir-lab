Assignment 5: Implement K-means clustering algorithm
Due: 4th April
Version: 5.0

Implement k-means algorithms with k=10 over hindi news stories.

i) consider documents in vector space where top 10k words are used to represent the documents and obtain clusters.
ii) Perform LSI over the documents to project them in latent space of size 200 and then obtain cluseters.

Print top 5 story titles for each clusters with both of the above methods.

You may use external libraries for LSI e.g. svdlibc

General notes: 

- Use your software design skills as much as possible like, OOP concepts, code reusability (refactoring), documentation and unit tests.
