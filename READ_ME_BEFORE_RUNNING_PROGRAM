(1) Here I have modified the qrel file and query_Hindi file according to my convinnience. The data is the same as you have given but I have modified its serial number according to my convinience. For example, english-00001.txt to 1,english-00012.txt to 12 etc.
 
(2) The program by itself takes the qrel and query_HINDI file, no need to explicitly give it the file path of those.

(3) Only input corpus folder path and stopwords file path

(4) Here the output will have 

	(a) query id | Recall | Precision | Average Precision
	
	(b) MRR - For extra credits

		And also I have implemented MRR for extra credits.

	        which will be shown in output at the end of the (a) part of the output.
