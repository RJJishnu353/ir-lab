First run docVectorFile.java
   -- This will make a folder with a name that was given as input to this program during execution
   
Now run the Assignment5_Kmeans.java
   -- This will take the document vector folder path, number of clusters and corpus folder path as input
      and will do clustering(KMeans) and output top 5 documents from each cluster
       
      NOTE : If the cluster has document count >= 5, then top 5 will be shown according to their closeness to the
             centroid else all the documents inside the cluster according to its closeness will be displayed.
             
             Ranking of docs show nearness to centroid of appropriate cluster.
               

KMeansWorking.java is just a trial code version, but it's a very handy piece of code and I want to archive it. So I am uploading it with my assignment.

It has nothing to do with assignment
